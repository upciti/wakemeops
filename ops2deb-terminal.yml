  summary: new type of shell written in rust
  description: |-
    The goal of this project is to take the Unix philosophy of shells, where pipes
    connect simple commands together, and bring it to the modern style of
    development. Thus, rather than being either a shell, or a programming language,
    Nushell connects both by bringing a rich programming language and a full-
    featured shell together into one package.

    Nu takes cues from a lot of familiar territory: traditional shells like bash,
    object based shells like PowerShell, gradually typed languages like TypeScript,
    functional programming, systems programming, and more. But rather than trying
    to be a jack of all trades, Nu focuses its energy on doing a few things well:

    - Being a flexible cross-platform shell with a modern feel
    - Solving problems as a modern programming language that works with the
    structure of your data
    - Giving clear error messages and clean IDE support

  summary: portable command-line YAML processor
  description: |-
    Lightweight and portable command-line YAML processor. yq uses jq like syntax
    but works with yaml files as well as json. It doesn't yet support everything jq
    does - but it does support the most common operations and functions, and more
    is being added continuously.
