## [boundary](https://www.boundaryproject.io)

__Provide simple and secure access to hosts and services__

 Traditional approaches like SSH bastion hosts or VPNs require distributing and
 managing credentials, configuring network controls like firewalls, and exposing
 the private network. Boundary provides a secure way to access hosts and
 critical systems without having to manage credentials or expose your network,
 and is entirely open source.
 Boundary is designed to be straightforward to understand, highly scalable, and
 resilient. It can run in clouds, on-prem, secure enclaves and more, and does
 not require an agent to be installed on every end host.

## [feroxbuster](https://github.com/epi052/feroxbuster)

__Fast, simple, recursive content discovery tool__

 feroxbuster is a tool designed to perform Forced Browsing.
 Forced browsing is an attack where the aim is to enumerate and access
 resources that are not referenced by the web application, but are still
 accessible by an attacker.
 feroxbuster uses brute force combined with a wordlist to search for
 unlinked content in target directories. These resources may store
 sensitive information about web applications and operational systems,
 such as source code, credentials, internal network addressing, etc...
 This attack is also known as Predictable Resource Location,
 File Enumeration, Directory Enumeration, and Resource Enumeration.
