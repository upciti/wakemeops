summary: code generator for Kubernetes controllers and CRDs
description: |-
  Kubebuilder makes use of this tool for generating utility code and Kubernetes
  YAML. This code and config generation is controlled by the presence of special
  "marker comments" in Go code.

  Controller-gen is built out of different "generators" (which specify what to
  generate) and "output rules" (which specify how and where to write the
  results).
