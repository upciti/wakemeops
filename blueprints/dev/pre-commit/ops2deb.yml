summary: framework for managing and maintaining multi-language pre-commit hooks
description: |-
  Multi-language package manager for pre-commit hooks. You specify a list of
  hooks you want and pre-commit manages the installation and execution of any
  hook written in any language before every commit. pre-commit is specifically
  designed to not require root access. If one of your developers doesn’t have
  node installed but modifies a JavaScript file, pre-commit automatically handles
  downloading and building node to run eslint without root.
