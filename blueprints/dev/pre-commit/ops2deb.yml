  description: |-
    Multi-language package manager for pre-commit hooks. You specify a list of
    hooks you want and pre-commit manages the installation and execution of any
    hook written in any language before every commit. pre-commit is specifically
    designed to not require root access. If one of your developers doesn’t have
    node installed but modifies a JavaScript file, pre-commit automatically handles
    downloading and building node to run eslint without root.
