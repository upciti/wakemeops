summary: self-contained and portable CPython build
description: |-
  Fully-usable, full-featured Python installation: most extension modules from
  the Python standard library are present and their library dependencies are
  either distributed with the distribution or are statically linked.
  Python distributions form the python-build-standalone project are built in a
  manner to minimize run-time dependencies. This includes limiting the CPU
  instructions that can be used and limiting the set of shared libraries required
  at run-time. The goal is for the produced distribution to work on any system
  for the targeted architecture.
