summary: SDK for building Kubernetes APIs using CRDs
description: |-
  Kubebuilder is a framework for building Kubernetes APIs using custom resource
  definitions (CRDs).

  Similar to web development frameworks such as Ruby on Rails and SpringBoot,
  Kubebuilder increases velocity and reduces the complexity managed by developers
  for rapidly building and publishing Kubernetes APIs in Go.
  It builds on top of the canonical techniques used to build the core Kubernetes
  APIs to provide simple abstractions that reduce boilerplate and toil.

  Kubebuilder does not exist as an example to copy-paste, but instead provides
  powerful libraries and tools to simplify building and publishing Kubernetes
  APIs from scratch. It provides a plugin architecture allowing users to take
  advantage of optional helpers and features.
