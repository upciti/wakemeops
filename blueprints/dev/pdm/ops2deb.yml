summary: modern Python package and dependency manager supporting the latest PEP standards
description: |-
  PDM is meant to be a next generation Python package management tool. It was
  originally built for personal use. If you feel you are going well with Pipenv
  or Poetry and don't want to introduce another package manager, just stick to
  it. But if you are missing something that is not present in those tools, you
  can probably find some goodness in pdm.

  Highlights of features:

  * Simple and fast dependency resolver, mainly for large binary distributions.
  * A PEP 517 build backend.
  * PEP 621 project metadata.
  * Flexible and powerful plug-in system.
  * Versatile user scripts.
  * Opt-in centralized installation cache like pnpm.
