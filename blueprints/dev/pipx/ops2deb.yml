summary: execute binaries from Python packages in isolated environments
description: |-
  pipx allows you to...

   * Run the latest version of a CLI application from a package
     in a temporary virtual environment,
     leaving your system untouched after it finishes.
   * Install packages to isolated virtual environments,
     while globally exposing their CLI applications
     so you can run them from anywhere.
   * Easily list, upgrade, and uninstall packages
     that were installed with pipx.

  pipx runs with regular user permissions, never calling "sudo pip install".
