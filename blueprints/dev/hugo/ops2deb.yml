summary: fast and flexible Static Site Generator
description: |-
  Hugo is a static site generator written in Go. It is optimized for speed, ease
  of use, and configurability. Hugo takes a directory with content and templates,
  and renders them into a full HTML website.

  Hugo relies on Markdown files with front matter for meta data. And you can run
  Hugo from any directory. This works well for shared hosts and other systems
  where you donâ€™t have a privileged account.

  Hugo renders a typical website of moderate size in a fraction of a second. A
  good rule of thumb is that each piece of content renders in around 1
  millisecond.

  Hugo is meant to work well for any kind of website including blogs, tumblelogs
  and docs.
