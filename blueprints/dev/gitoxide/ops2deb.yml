summary: idiomatic, lean, fast & safe pure Rust implementation of Git
description: |-
  gitoxide is an implementation of git written in Rust for developing future-
  proof applications which strive for correctness and performance while providing
  a pleasant and unsurprising developer experience. It provides the gix and
  ein binaries for use on the command-line to allow experimentation with key
  features like fetch and clone. It aspires to be a production-grade server
  implementation and the ein binary aspires to become the default way to interact
  with git repositories.
