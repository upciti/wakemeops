summary: Just a command runner - Make alternative written in Rust
description: |-
  just is a handy way to save and run project-specific commands.

  Commands, called recipes, are stored in a file called 'justfile' with a syntax
  that is inspired by make. You can then run them with 'just RECIPE'.

  Key features:
  - Simple, intuitive syntax
  - Support for aliases and positional arguments
  - Cross-platform shell support
  - .env file integration
  - String interpolation and conditionals
  - Recipe dependencies and parameters
