summary: Kubernetes manifests validator with Custom Resource support
description: |-
  Incorporate it into your CI, or use it locally to validate your Kubernetes
  configuration!

  Inspired by and designed to stay close to Kubeval, but with these improvements:
  • High performance: validates & downloads manifests over multiple routines,
    caching downloaded files in memory
  • Configurable list of remote or local schemas locations, enabling validating
    Kubernetes custom resources (CRDs) and offline validation capabilities
  • Uses by default a self-updating fork of the schemas registry maintained by
    the kubernetes-json-schema project - guaranteeing up-to-date schemas for
    all recent versions of Kubernetes
