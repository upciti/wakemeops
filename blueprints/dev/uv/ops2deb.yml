summary: extremely fast Python package installer and resolver
description: |-
  Designed as a drop-in replacement for pip and pip-compile.

  - Drop-in replacement for common pip, pip-tools, and virtualenv commands.
  - 10-100x faster than pip and pip-tools (pip-compile and pip-sync).
  - Disk-space efficient, with a global cache for dependency deduplication.
  - Installable via curl, pip, pipx, etc. uv is a static binary that can be
  installed without Rust or Python.
  - Tested at-scale against the top 10,000 PyPI packages.
  - Advanced features such as dependency version overrides and alternative
  resolution strategies.
  - Best-in-class error messages with a conflict-tracking resolver.
  - Support for a wide range of advanced pip features, including editable
  installs, Git dependencies, direct URL dependencies, local dependencies,
  constraints, source distributions, HTML and JSON indexes, and more.
