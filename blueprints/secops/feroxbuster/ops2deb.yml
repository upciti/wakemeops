    Tool designed to perform Forced Browsing.
    Forced browsing is an attack where the aim is to enumerate and access
    resources that are not referenced by the web application, but are still
    accessible by an attacker.
    feroxbuster uses brute force combined with a wordlist to search for
    unlinked content in target directories. These resources may store
    sensitive information about web applications and operational systems,
    such as source code, credentials, internal network addressing, etc...
    This attack is also known as Predictable Resource Location,
    File Enumeration, Directory Enumeration, and Resource Enumeration.
