summary: kubernetes security platform for your IDE, CI/CD pipelines, and clusters
description: |-
  Kubescape is an open-source Kubernetes security platform. It includes risk
  analysis, security compliance, and misconfiguration scanning. Targeted at the
  DevSecOps practitioner or platform engineer, it offers an easy-to-use CLI
  interface, flexible output formats, and automated scanning capabilities. It
  saves Kubernetes users and admins precious time, effort, and resources.

  Kubescape scans clusters, YAML files, and Helm charts. It detects
  misconfigurations according to multiple frameworks (including NSA-CISA, MITRE
  ATT&CKÂ® and the CIS Benchmark).
