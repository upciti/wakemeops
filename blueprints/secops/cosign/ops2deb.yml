  Cosign is a command line utility that is used to sign software artifacts and
  verify signatures using Sigstore.

  Sigstore has a number of language specific clients that you can use to build
  custom tooling. Although a number of the clients include a basic CLI, Cosign is
  the recommended tool for signing and verifying.
