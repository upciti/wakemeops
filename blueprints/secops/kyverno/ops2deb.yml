summary: set of tools to manage the complete Policy-as-Code (PaC) lifecycle for Kubernetes
  and other cloud native environments
description: |-
  Kyverno policies are declarative YAML resources and no new language is
  required. Kyverno enables use of familiar tools such as kubectl, git, and
  kustomize to manage policies. Kyverno supports JMESPath and the Common
  Expressions Language (CEL) for efficient handling of complex logic.

  In Kubernetes environments, Kyverno policies can validate, mutate, generate,
  and cleanup any Kubernetes resource, including custom resources. To help secure
  the software supply chain Kyverno policies can verify OCI container image
  signatures and artifacts. Kyverno policy reports and policy exceptions are also
  Kubernetes API resources.

  The Kyverno CLI can be used to apply and test policies off-cluster e.g., as
  part of an IaC and CI/CD pipelines.
