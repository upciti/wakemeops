summary: end-of-life (EOL) package scanner for container images, systems, and SBOMs
description: |-
  End of Life (EOL) means the vendor has decided the software in question has
  reached the end of its “useful lifespan.” After this particular date, the
  manufacturer no longer markets, sells, provides technical support, sustains,
  enhances, or fixes the product. Note that End of Life (EOL) and End of Support
  (EOS) are being treated as the same by xeol, even though various vendors may
  use these terms differently. EOL Software is a security risk because it is no
  longer being maintained and receiving security updates.

  The data that xeol uses to determine if a package is EOL is sourced from
  endoflife.date. While endoflife.date includes extended support dates, xeol does
  not currently support this and we only match on the standard EOL support dates
  from vendors.
