summary: powerful IDE for kubernetes
description: |-
  OpenLens (aka Lens Desktop Core) is the open source project on which Lens
  Desktop is built.
  It provides the full situational awareness for everything that runs in
  Kubernetes. Itâ€™s lowering the barrier of entry for people just getting started
  and radically improving productivity for people with more experience.

  Lens is built on open source and backed by a number of Kubernetes and cloud
  native ecosystem pioneers. With over 350,000 users and 16,000 stars on GitHub,
  itâ€™s the largest and most advanced Kubernetes platform in the world.
