summary: powerful IDE for kubernetes
description: |-
  OpenLens (aka Lens Desktop Core) is the open source project on which Lens
  Desktop is built.
  It provides the full situational awareness for everything that runs in
  Kubernetes. It’s lowering the barrier of entry for people just getting started
  and radically improving productivity for people with more experience.

  Lens is built on open source and backed by a number of Kubernetes and cloud
  native ecosystem pioneers. With over 350,000 users and 16,000 stars on GitHub,
  it’s the largest and most advanced Kubernetes platform in the world.
