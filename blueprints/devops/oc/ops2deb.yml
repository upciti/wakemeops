summary: command line client for controlling an Openshift cluster
description: |-
  The OpenShift command-line interface (CLI), allows you to create applications
  and manage OpenShift Container Platform projects from a terminal. The OpenShift
  CLI is ideal for working directly with project source code, scripting OpenShift
  Container Platform operations or managing projects while restricted by
  bandwidth resources and the web console is unavailable.
