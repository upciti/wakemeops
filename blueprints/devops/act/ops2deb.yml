    Why would you want to do this? Two reasons:

    - Fast Feedback: Rather than having to commit/push every time you want to test
    out the changes you are making to your .github/workflows/ files (or for any
    changes to embedded GitHub actions), you can use act to run the actions
    locally. The environment variables and filesystem are all configured to match
    what GitHub provides.
    - Local Task Runner: With act, you can use the GitHub Actions defined in your
    .github/workflows/ to replace your Makefile!
