  summary: fast, local development for kubernetes and openshift microservices
  description: |-
    Open source tool that lets you run a single service locally, while connecting
    that service to a remote Kubernetes cluster. This lets developers working on
    multi-service applications to:

    - Do fast local development of a single service, even if that service depends
    on other services in your cluster. Make a change to your service, save, and you
    can immediately see the new service in action.
    - Use any tool installed locally to test/debug/edit your service. For example,
    you can use a debugger or IDE!
    - Make your local development machine operate as if it's part of your
    Kubernetes cluster. If you've got an application on your machine that you want
    to run against a service in the cluster -- it's easy to do.
