summary: Kubernetes Cloud Provider for KIND
description: |-
  KIND has demonstrated to be a very versatile, efficient, cheap and very useful
  tool for Kubernetes testing.
  However, KIND doesn't offer capabilities for testing all the features that
  depend on cloud-providers,
  specifically the Load Balancers, causing a gap on testing and a bad user
  experience,
  since is not easy to connect to the applications running on the cluster.

  cloud-provider-kind aims to fill this gap and provide an agnostic and cheap
  solution for all
  the Kubernetes features that depend on a cloud-provider using KIND.
