    kustomize lets you customize raw, template-free YAML files for multiple
    purposes, leaving the original YAML untouched and usable as is. kustomize
    targets Kubernetes; it understands and can patch Kubernetes style API objects.
    It's like make, in that what it does is declared in a file, and it's like sed,
    in that it emits edited text.
