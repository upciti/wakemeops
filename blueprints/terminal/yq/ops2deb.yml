summary: portable command-line YAML processor
description: |-
  Lightweight and portable command-line YAML processor. yq uses jq like syntax
  but works with yaml files as well as json. It doesn't yet support everything jq
  does - but it does support the most common operations and functions, and more
  is being added continuously.
