  summary: portable command-line YAML processor
  description: |-
    Lightweight and portable command-line YAML processor. yq uses jq like syntax
    but works with yaml files as well as json. It doesn't yet support everything jq
    does - but it does support the most common operations and functions, and more
    is being added continuously.
