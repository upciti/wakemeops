summary: allows to query and modify data structures using selector strings
description: |-
  Say good bye to learning new tools just to work with a different data format.
  Dasel uses a standard selector syntax no matter the data format.
  This means that once you learn how to use dasel you immediately have the
  ability to query/modify any of the supported data types without any additional
  tools or effort.
