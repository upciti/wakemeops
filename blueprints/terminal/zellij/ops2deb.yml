description: |-
  Zellij is a workspace aimed at developers, ops-oriented people and anyone who
  loves the terminal. At its core, it is a terminal multiplexer (similar to tmux
  and GNU Screen), but this is merely its infrastructure layer. Zellij includes a
  layout system, and a plugin system allowing one to create plugins in any
  language that compiles to WebAssembly.
