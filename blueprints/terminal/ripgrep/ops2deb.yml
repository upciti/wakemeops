  ripgrep is a line-oriented search tool that recursively searches the current

  and automatically skip hidden files/directories and binary files. ripgrep has
  first class support on Windows, macOS and Linux, with binary downloads
  available for every release. ripgrep is similar to other popular search tools
  like The Silver Searcher, ack and grep.
