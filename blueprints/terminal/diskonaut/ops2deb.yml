summary: terminal disk space navigator
description: |-
  Given a path on your hard-drive (which could also be the root path, eg. /)
  diskonaut scans it and indexes its metadata to memory so that you could explore
  its contents (even while still scanning!). Once completed, you can navigate
  through subfolders, getting a visual treemap representation of what's taking up
  your disk space. You can even delete files or folders and diskonaut will track
  how much space you've freed up in this session.
