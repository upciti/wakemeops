summary: heavily refactored vim fork
description: |-
  Neovim is a fork of Vim focused on modern code and features, rather than
  running in legacy environments.

  msgpack API enables structured communication to/from any programming language.
  Remote plugins run as co-processes that communicate with Neovim safely and
  asynchronously.

  GUIs (or TUIs) can easily embed Neovim or communicate via TCP sockets using
  the discoverable msgpack API.
