summary: A command-line fuzzy finder in Go
description: |-
  fzf is a general-purpose command-line fuzzy finder.
  It’s an interactive filter program for any kind of list; files, command
  history, processes, hostnames, bookmarks, git commits, etc.
  With its novel “fuzzy” matching algorithm, you can quickly type in patterns
  with omitted characters and still get the results you want.
