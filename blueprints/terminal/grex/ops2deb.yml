  summary: command-line tool and library for generating regular expressions
  description: |-
    grex is a library as well as a command-line utility that is meant to simplify
    the often complicated and tedious task of creating regular expressions. It does
    so by automatically generating a single regular expression from user-provided
    test cases. The resulting expression is guaranteed to match the test cases
    which it was generated from.
