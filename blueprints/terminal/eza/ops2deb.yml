summary: modern, maintained replacement for ls, built on exa
description: |-
  eza uses colours for information by default, helping you distinguish between
  many types of files, such as whether you are the owner, or in the owning group.
  It also has extra features not present in the original ls, such as viewing the
  Git status for a directory, or recursing into directories with a tree view.
