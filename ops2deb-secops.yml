  summary: provide simple and secure access to hosts and services
  description: |-
    Traditional approaches like SSH bastion hosts or VPNs require distributing and
    managing credentials, configuring network controls like firewalls, and exposing
    the private network. Boundary provides a secure way to access hosts and
    critical systems without having to manage credentials or expose your network,
    and is entirely open source.
    Boundary is designed to be straightforward to understand, highly scalable, and
    resilient. It can run in clouds, on-prem, secure enclaves and more, and does
    not require an agent to be installed on every end host.

  summary: fast, simple, recursive content discovery tool
  description: |-
    Tool designed to perform Forced Browsing.
    Forced browsing is an attack where the aim is to enumerate and access
    resources that are not referenced by the web application, but are still
    accessible by an attacker.
    feroxbuster uses brute force combined with a wordlist to search for
    unlinked content in target directories. These resources may store
    sensitive information about web applications and operational systems,
    such as source code, credentials, internal network addressing, etc...
    This attack is also known as Predictable Resource Location,
    File Enumeration, Directory Enumeration, and Resource Enumeration.
